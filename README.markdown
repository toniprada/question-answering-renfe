# What is this?

This is the final work for the TEPR (*TEcnolog√≠as de Pregunta-Respuesta* = Question-Answering Technologies) subject at ETSIT-UPM. It's a Question answering and data mining system for getting trips info from the Renfe website (Spain's main train operator company).

It uses Unitex for Natural Language Understanding and JASON for multi-agents development. The project can be executed with JASON and the included Chrome Extension.

*I'm not the author of a big part of the project, as we were asked to complete the agents and the NLU system, while the scrapper and the skeleton of the project was given to us.*
