# What is this?

This is the final work for the TEPR (*TEcnolog√≠as de Pregunta-Respuesta* = Question-Answering Technologies) at ETSIT-UPM.

It uses Unitex for Natural Language Understanding and JASON for multi-agents development. The project can be executed with JASON and the Chrome Extension included. 

*I'm  not the author of great part of the project, as we were asked to complete the agents and the NLU system.*
